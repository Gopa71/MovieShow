# 6:Create a program that asks the user for the current hour (in 24-hour format) and greets them based on the time of day using elif statements:

# 5 AM to 11:59 AM: "Good morning!"
# 12 PM to 4:59 PM: "Good afternoon!"
# 5 PM to 8:59 PM: "Good evening!"
# 9 PM to 4:59 AM: "Good night!"
# If the input is not a valid hour (e.g., less than 0 or greater than 23), print "Invalid input."
