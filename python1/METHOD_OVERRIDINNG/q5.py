# Question 4: Create a base class called Employee. Define a method in the Employee class called calculate_salary() that returns 0. Create two subclasses, Manager and Developer. Override the calculate_salary() method in both subclasses to calculate and return the salary for a manager and a developer, respectively. Create instances of both subclasses and call their calculate_salary() methods to calculate and display the salaries.
